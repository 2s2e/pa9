     *   For a busy block with a total size of 24 (i.e. 20B payload + 4B header),
     *   If the previous block is allocated, size_status should be set to 27;

     *   size_status should be 1 (i.e. zero sized busy block). see VM_ENDMARK macro.
     *
     * When we want to read the size, we should ignore the last two bits.
